Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

Bug reports
===========

When reporting a bug <https://todo.sr.ht/~sthagen/leeway> please include:

    * Your operating system name and version.
    * Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
    * Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Documentation improvements
==========================

leeway could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official leeway docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Feature requests and feedback
=============================

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://todo.sr.ht/~sthagen/leeway.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that code contributions are welcome :)

Development
===========

To set up `leeway` for local development:

1. Fork leeway from e.g. <https://git.sr.ht/~sthagen/leeway>
   (look for the "clone read-only" section / link).
2. Clone your fork locally:

    git clone https://git.sr.ht/~sthagen/leeway

3. Perform your local development:

   Change the code or docs until make fully passes again.

4. Commit your changes:

    git add .
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."

5. Use git send-email to send changes upstream.

    Some help for that is available at eg <https://git-send-email.io>
